## Updating from a Previous Version

If you have previously installed a version that is older than 3.0.0, it's important to follow these steps to ensure a smooth update process. The new version introduces significant changes that might conflict with remnants of the old installation.

It's recommended to use the clean command to remove any residual configurations that might still be present. Run the following command:

```shell
commitizen-cli clean
```

## Commands

### Update Command

The update command allows you to synchronize your local package with the latest changes from the package's repository. To update your package, run:

```shell
commitizen-cli update
```

This command will fetch the latest updates and apply them to your local package installation. Staying up to date ensures that you have access to new features, bug fixes, and enhancements provided by the package maintainers.

### Config Command

The config command is used to configure various settings for your package. It supports both get and set modes.

Get Mode

To retrieve configuration values, use the get mode:

```shell
commitizen-cli config get <key>
```

This command will display the current value associated with the specified configuration key.

Set Mode

To update configuration values, use the set mode:

```shell
commitizen-cli config set <key>=<value>
```

### Clean Command

The clean command allows you to reset the configuration settings. This command will clear all configurations inside the configuration file generated by the package. To reset the configuration, execute:

```shell
commitizen-cli clean
```

Please be cautious when using this command, as it will reset all configuration settings. This action is irreversible.
